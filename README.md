Utility that automatically generates F# modules and functions based on your F# project file's references.

## Usage
Add the following under an `<ItemGroup>` to your `.fsproj` project file

```xml
<PackageReference Include="FSharpWrap" Version="0.1.0">
  <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
  <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers</IncludeAssets>
</PackageReference>

<!-- Make sure this comes before any of your *.fs files -->
<Compile Include="output.autogen.fs" />
```

Depending on your needs, you may also want to add the following to your `.gitignore` file

```text
*.autogen.fs
```

To exclude entire assemblies from code generation, use the following in your project file

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- This will exclude an assembly file whose file name is an exact match -->
  <FSharpWrapExcludeAssemblyFiles Include="Assembly.To.Exclude.dll" />
  <FSharpWrapExcludeAssemblyFiles Include="Other.Assembly.To.Exclude.dll" />

  <!--
    By default, FSharpWrap excludes some assemblies from code generation
    For an exact list, go to "./src/FSharpWrap/FSharpWrap.targets"
  -->
</ItemGroup>
```

## Example
A dependency containing the following C# class:

```cs
public class ExampleDictionary<TKey, TValue>
{
    public void SetItem(TKey key, TValue value);
}
```

Could then be used in the following way:
```fs
let myDict = new ExampleDictionary<string, int>()
ExampleDictionary.setItem "hello" 5 myDict
```
